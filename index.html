        <code>Gesture Drawing</code>

         <p>Gesture drawing is a technique used in figure drawing that focuses on capturing the essence of the subject's movement and form. It emphasizes overall pose and flow rather than intricate details. It is usually completed in a short time frame of seconds to minutes, encouraging quick execution. This quick approach helps artists work intuitively and develop observation skills.

Gesture drawing often begins with simple shapes and lines, allowing the artist to understand the proportions and basic structure of a figure. By prioritizing movement and rhythm, artists can convey a sense of life and dynamism to their work. It is often used in art classes for warm-ups and developing drawing skills. Practicing gesture drawing builds confidence and helps artists loosen up their style.

Ultimately, gesture drawing serves as a foundational practice, preparing artists for more detailed and refined work. It is an essential tool for anyone looking to improve their figure drawing abilities and enhance their overall artistic expression.</p>

    <section id="Contour Drawing" class="main-section">
        <code>Contour Drawing</code>

        <img src="img/image_123650291 (26).JPG" alt="Contour Drawing">


         <p>Contour drawing is a technique that focuses on outlining the basic shapes and edges of an object. Without lifting the pencil from the paper, you draw a contour line that defines the shape of the object. This technique encourages the artist to carefully observe and capture the contours and details of the object.

Contour drawing emphasizes the relationship between different elements and promotes an understanding of proportion and spatial relationships. It often begins with a slow, deliberate approach, allowing the artist to explore the texture and surface of the object. The resulting lines can vary in thickness and intensity, contributing to the overall expression of the drawing.

Unlike gesture drawing, which captures movement, contour drawing prioritizes precision and detail. This technique helps develop hand-eye coordination and observation skills. Ultimately, contour drawing serves as a foundational exercise that enhances an artist's ability to portray an object accurately and expressively</p>

         <code>Shading</code>

         <img src="img/image_123650291 (27).JPG" alt="Shading">

         <p>Shading is a technique used in drawing and painting to create the illusion of depth, volume, and texture through the manipulation of light and shadow. By varying the intensity of tones, artists can depict how light interacts with surfaces, giving a three-dimensional quality to two-dimensional works. The fundamental goal of shading is to represent light falling on an object, which helps convey its form and spatial relationship to the viewer.</p>

    <section id="Blending" class="main-section">
        <code>Blending</code>
        
        <img src="img/image_123650291 (30).JPG" alt="Blending">

         <p>Blending is a shading technique used in drawing and painting to achieve smooth transitions of colors and tones for a softer, more realistic look. This method often involves using tools such as blending stamps, fingers, or soft brushes to blend and smooth lines and edges.

In pencil drawings, blending eliminates harsh lines and allows for gradations that mimic light and shadow effects. Blending allows artists to achieve a variety of textures and depth, enhancing the three-dimensional quality of their work.

Blending is especially useful in portrait and landscape paintings, where subtle value shifts are essential for realism. Careful control of the blending process allows artists to create mood and atmosphere in their work. Overall, blending is an essential technique for creating sophisticated and polished works of art.</p>

        <img src="img/image_123650291 (29).JPG" alt="Sketching">

         <p>Sketching is a basic drawing technique that creates a quick, rough representation of a subject. It serves as a way for artists to capture ideas, explore composition, and practice their observational skills.

Sketches are usually drawn with minimal detail and can vary in style from simple outlines to more developed studies. This informal approach allows artists to express their thoughts and concepts without feeling the pressure of producing a finished piece.

Sketching can be done in a variety of mediums, including pencil, charcoal, ink, and digital tools. Sketching is often the basis for more detailed artwork and helps artists refine their ideas and techniques. Overall, sketching is an essential practice for anyone wanting to improve their drawing skills and creativity.</p>
